# Diabetes-Prediction-Project
Hi. This is my Python project working on predicting whether an individual having diabetes. In the code, I tried different classification methods and find the method that achieves the highest accuracy score. There are three jupyter notebook files, and there are working on different dataset. The file starts with "(1)" is what I applied different classification models on the original dataset. (2) and (3) are attempts I tried to shrink dataset, use the same classification models, and increase accuracy score.
